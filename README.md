There are three parts to the project. For each of them one needs to add the database from this google drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/149x43YrwtffJuDMm-q_130BOTxfD7iaq?usp=sharing.
Add this folder to the drive or "Copy a shortcut" of the folder to your drive

Number of enabled users can be controlled in the second block of each of the three parts in order to run the parts on a limited set of data only.

In the part Connected_user: Intermediate data already processed for all users is available in the drive and one can switch to saved data to save time. It takes atleast 3 hours to run this part for entire dataset.

For plotting the data on maps, the corresponding map files need to be uploaded to colab. The map files are provided.
